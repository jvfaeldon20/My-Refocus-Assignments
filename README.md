# My-Refocus-Assignments


Hi everyone! I am JV. One of the students here in Refocus, under cohort7. 
I've been working already in the software industry for 6 years and currently working 
as a Frontend Engineer here in Trend Micro. 

The main reason I also enrolled here in Refocus is to master the concepts of Javascript and to become a 
Fullstack developer soon so that I can earn higher salary and broaden my skills horizontally in Web development.
